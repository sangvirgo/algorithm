It is Gregâ€™s birthday! To celebrate, his friend Sam invites Greg and two other friends for a small party. Of course, every birthday party must have cake.

Sam ordered a square cake. She makes a single horizontal cut and a single vertical cut. In her excitement to eat cake, Sam forgot to make these cuts through the middle of the cake.

Of course, the biggest piece of cake should go to Greg since it is his birthday. Help Sam determine the volume of the biggest piece of cake that resulted from these two cuts.

Input
The input consists of a single line containing three integers 
 (
), the length of the sides of the square cake in centimeters,
